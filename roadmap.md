# E-Commerce Price Tracker Roadmap

## **Phase 1: Planning and Preparation**

### 1. Define the Project Scope
- Decide on the e-commerce sites to scrape (e.g., Amazon, eBay, local retailers).
- Identify the data points to collect (e.g., product name, price, availability, ratings).

### 2. Research Website Structure
- Use browser developer tools (Inspect Element) to locate HTML elements for product details.
- Check if the site has anti-bot measures or CAPTCHAs (consider using proxies or Selenium if necessary).

### 3. Set Up the Environment
- Install Python.
- Create a virtual environment:
  ```bash
  python -m venv env
  source env/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
  env\Scripts\activate   # Windows
  ```
- Install essential libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas matplotlib schedule
  ```

## **Phase 2: Basic Scraper**

### 1. Build a Simple Scraper
- Write a script to fetch a single product’s details (name, price, etc.).
- Use `requests` to get the webpage content.
- Parse the HTML using `BeautifulSoup`.

### 2. Handle Dynamic Content
- If data is loaded dynamically (e.g., JavaScript), use Selenium or Playwright to render the page.

### 3. Test and Refine
- Test the scraper on different products.
- Add error handling for missing data or network issues.

---

## **Phase 3: Data Storage**

### 1. Choose a Storage Method
- **CSV**: Suitable for small-scale tracking.
- **Database (SQLite/MySQL)**: Better for large datasets and advanced queries.

### 2. Implement Data Storage
- Write scraped data into a CSV file or database.
- Ensure proper formatting (e.g., convert prices to numeric values).

---

## **Phase 4: Automate the Scraper**

### 1. Set Up Automation
- Use `schedule` or `APScheduler` to run the scraper at specific intervals (e.g., daily).

### 2. Logging
- Add logging to track scraper execution and errors.

### 3. Monitor Ethical Constraints
- Respect website terms of service.
- Use a delay between requests to avoid overloading servers.

---

## **Phase 5: Data Analysis and Visualisation**

### 1. Load the Data
- Use `pandas` to read and manipulate the stored data.

### 2. Create Visualisations
- Plot price trends using `matplotlib` or `seaborn`.
- Highlight key insights (e.g., lowest price, average price).

### 3. Test on Historical Data
- Simulate a few weeks of tracking to ensure visualisations work as intended.

---

## **Phase 6: Add Notifications**

### 1. Set Price Alerts
- Define a threshold price for notifications.
- Send email alerts using `smtplib` or integrate with APIs like Twilio (for SMS) or Slack.

### 2. Test Notifications
- Verify that alerts are triggered correctly when conditions are met.

---

## **Phase 7: Advanced Features**

### 1. Expand to Multiple Websites
- Write separate scraper functions for each e-commerce site.
- Standardise the output format (e.g., same column names).

### 2. Add Support for Proxies
- Use tools like `requests_proxies` to avoid IP bans on sites with strict anti-bot measures.

### 3. Integrate with a Dashboard
- Use Flask/Django to build a front-end dashboard where users can:
  - View price trends.
  - Add/remove products to track.
  - Set custom price alerts.

### 4. Deploy
- Host the application on a server (e.g., AWS, Heroku).
- Schedule the scraper to run on the server.

---

## **Phase 8: Maintenance and Scaling**

### 1. Monitor Performance
- Regularly test the scraper to ensure it works as sites update their HTML structure.
- Optimise code for speed and reliability.

### 2. Gather Feedback
- If it’s a user-facing project, gather feedback to improve functionality.

### 3. Add New Features
- Scrape additional data points (e.g., reviews, delivery time).
- Support more complex visualisations (e.g., interactive charts).

## **Suggested Timeline**
- **Week 1**: Planning and basic scraper.
- **Week 2**: Data storage and automation.
- **Week 3**: Visualisation and notifications.
- **Week 4**: Advanced features and deployment.
